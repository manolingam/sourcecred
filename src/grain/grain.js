/**
 * This module contains the types for tracking Grain, which is the native
 * project-specific, cred-linked token created in SourceCred instances. In
 * practice, projects can call these tokens anything they want, but we will
 * refer to the tokens as "Grain" throughout the codebase. The conserved
 * properties of all Grains are that they are minted/distributed based on cred
 * scores, and that they can be used to Boost contributions in a cred graph.
 *
 * Grain is represented by [BigInt]s so that we can avoid precision issues.
 * Following the convention for ERC20 tokens, we will track and format Grain
 * with 18 decimals of precision.
 *
 * Unfortunately Flow does not support BigInts yet. For now, we will hack
 * around this by lying to Flow and claiming that the BigInts are actually
 * numbers. Whenever we actually construct a BigInt, we will
 * suppress the flow error at that declaration. Mixing BigInts with other types
 * (e.g. 5n + 3) produces a runtime error, so even though Flow will not save
 * us from these, they will be easy to detect. See [facebook/flow#6639][flow]

 * Formats a grain balance as a human-readable number, dividing the

 *
 * The client controls how many digits of precision are shown; by default, we
 * display zero digits. Grain balances will have commas added as
 * thousands-separators if the balance is greater than 1000g.
 *
 * The client also specifies a suffix; by default, we use 'g' for grain.
 *
 * Here are some examples of its behavior, pretending that we use 2 decimals
 * of precision for readability:
 *
 * format(133700042n) === "1,337,000g"
 * format(133700042n, 2) === "1,337,000.42g"
